/**
 * Allows OAuth2 Bearer authentication on the mcp_server endpoint.
 *
 * mcp_server's route declares `_auth: ['cookie']`, and Drupal core treats an
 * explicit `_auth` list as exhaustive — even GLOBAL providers such as
 * simple_oauth's `oauth2` are rejected with "The used authentication method
 * is not allowed on this route." The module's migration tools authenticate
 * exclusively via OAuth 2.1 client_credentials Bearer tokens, so `oauth2`
 * must be on the list. Idempotent: safe alongside any other module doing
 * the same (pagedesigner_mcp ships the identical subscriber).
 *
 * Also keeps the endpoint out of the redirect module's route normalizer. On
 * sites with language prefixes the normalizer answers `GET /mcp` with a 301 to
 * `/de/mcp`; the streamable-HTTP MCP client treats that as a dropped event
 * stream and reconnects every second, one loop per session — a migration
 * ingest turned that into ~1000 requests a minute against the source site.
 * A plain 405 on GET is what the client expects from a server without an
 * event stream, and it stops asking.
